# Biters Begone!

Pretty simple mod. It does two things, and does those things well:

- It prevents anything that belongs to the enemy force (biters, biter bases and worms in vanilla) from spawning on map chunk generation by deleting any entities in a newly spawned section.
- When first loading a save, **either new or existing**, it erases all enemy forces already in the map.

Basically, all biters go *kapoot* and no new ones will ever spawn while this mod is active. And because the map settings are left alone, disabling or removing "Biters Begone!" will restore biter spawning without any future side-effects. Neat!

Based on the original Biters Begone! by Dustine.  Happy to return ownership to her any time she wants.
